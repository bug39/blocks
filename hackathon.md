**OVERVIEW**
In this hackathon, you will design and build a proof-of-concept agentic AI solution using IBM watsonx Orchestrate, a low-code platform to build and deploy AI agents.

**PROMPT**
Every great idea deserves a faster path to reality. Use AI to simplify the steps that slow teams down — organizing work, connecting tools, or turning insights into action. Show how approachable, practical AI can make building and launching new solutions easier for everyone.


**Grading**
    Completeness and feasibility (5 points): How feasible is the solution? How fully has the idea been thought-out and planned? How complete is the proof-of-concept submitted? How clear is the application of IBM technology?
    Creativity and innovation (5 points): How unique and original was the approach in applying AI technology to address the stated issue? Is the solution differentiated in the market?
    Design and usability (5 points): How good is the design, user experience, and ease-of-use of the solution? How quickly and easily could it be put to use in real-world scenarios and adopted by target users?
    Effectiveness and efficiency (5 points): Does the solution address a high priority and relevant issue within the hackathon theme? Does it achieve its goal effectively and efficiently? Can it achieve a measurable impact in the field? Does it have potential to scale to more users or use cases?
